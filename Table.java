/* 'public static void main String[] args' is same as I mentioned in Sample.java
 * In this Table program it is printing table of 2
 * 
 * Execution -
 * 1st it create a variable of name i
 * 2nd - go inside the for loop (i=2) check if  i<=20, if it is yes then go inside the loop (if i~=20 then exit the loop)
 * 3rd - print i=2
 * 4th - goto loop, increment i by 2 check if it is less than 20 go inside and print 4
 * 5th - again goto loop, increment i by 2 check if it is less than 20 go inside and print 6
 * 6th - And lly execute it till i<=20, once i>20 then exit the loop 
 * And it will print 2's table
